# d7s-grove-arduino
This library is for evaluating Omron sensor D7S with Arduino UNO.  

D7S is the world's smallest class seismic sensor.
By adopting the SI value highly correlated with the seismic intensity class indicating the magnitude of the earthquake, it is possible to make a highly accurate earthquake judgment according to the seismic intensity class.
It is also possible to acquire earthquake related information in the sensor with the I2C interface.
